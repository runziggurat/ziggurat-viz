This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

> Note: We recommend using yarn v1 for consistency.

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing any page in `pages/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

> Note: Data fetching methods like `getStaticProps` are run each time a page is refreshed in development mode. So pages may feel slow. This is not the case in production mode.

## Build

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This can be used to simulate production environment. Use the following command to start the app in production mode after building:

```bash
yarn start
```
